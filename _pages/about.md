Sofia Shchukina
======
Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. I use experimental and applied microeconomic methods to study how contemporary technologies and sociocultural trends have affected human behavior in areas including dating, education, and purchasing decisions.

I am the lead researcher for the [University of Chicago's Dating with Data Study](https://datingwithdata.com/), where we study how people use dating apps.

You can contact me at [sofiashchukina@uchicago.edu](mailto:soiashchukina@uchicago.edu), or using any of the links in the sidebar.

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at UC Berkeley and as a Business Analyst at McKinsey & Company. I graduated _summa cum laude_ from Harvard College with a degree in Economics and a minor in Statistics.
