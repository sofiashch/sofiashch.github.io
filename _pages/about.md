About Me
======
Welcome! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. I am an applied microeconomist specializing in Behavioral Economics and the Economics of Education. 

I am the Lead Researcher for the [University of Chicago's Dating with Data Study](https://datingwithdata.com/), where we study how dating apps have affected relationship formation.

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at UC Berkeley and as a Business Analyst at McKinsey & Company. I graduated _summa cum laude_ from Harvard College with a degree in Economics and a minor in Statistics.
